1.	maybe in most cases you could use `List<object>` as `ArrayList`,
	so it may be possible to add such a feature that:
		once you create a generic type of method `GT<T>`, the compiler
		will generated a non-generic version `GT : GT<object>` of it.
	just like implement `operator+` will automatically implement `+=`.

2.	there is already a delegate Action for methods with no parameters 
	and no return value, so why creating delegate ThreadStart then?

3.	is it possible to write documents for a group of methods?
	especially overload methods. or there will be lots of redundant.

4.	why almost all collections implement ICollection except HashSet<T>?
	why there is IReadOnlyList<T> and IReadOnlyDictionary<T> but no IReadOnlySet<T>?
	why the Collection library can not be 'symmetric'?
